Getting a PhD Is Like Playing Poker 
====


Have you ever felt like the titles PhD and Dr. are reserved for forces of nature — people who seem effortlessly brilliant at everything they do — and you’re just not one of them?


Well, I’m here to tell you about my journey.

For the longest time, I thought those titles were only for straight-A students — the kind who never stumble — while I was more of an A-minus type who sometimes got a C. I’ve met truly brilliant people, the ones who seem to breathe solutions to difficult problems, the kind they make TV shows about.

And let me tell you: very few of them actually stayed in the field.

Some people are lucky — they have an older sibling or a parent who knows the system and passes down rare knowledge the rest of us have to fight to learn. For them, the path feels natural, even inevitable.

For others, the road to graduate school starts earlier, shaped by the company they keep as teenagers — the classes they take, the teachers who guide them. They ace their tests, collect praise, and grow used to that sense of validation.

And some of us find our way much later, maybe during undergrad, maybe even after.

No matter when or how, I truly believe that if you can dream it, you can become it.

Because in the end, a PhD is a lot like poker: everyone is dealt a different hand, but if you play enough rounds — with patience, strategy, and grit — you can flip the game entirely.
