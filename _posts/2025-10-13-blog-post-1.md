Automating with Shell scripts
======


I maintain a collection of handy **Bash shell scripts** for everyday tasks, including directory management, to-do automation, and fun utilities. You can explore the repository here:

[View Shell Scripts on GitHub](https://github.com/yysigari/shell_script.git)

Some highlights include:

- `create_directory.sh` — quickly create nested directories  
- `back_up_directory.sh` — backup folders efficiently  
- `make_to_do.sh` — manage to-do lists from the terminal  
- `todo_cal.sh` — calendar integration for your tasks  
- `guess_a_number.sh` — a fun guessing game in Bash  
- `when_sad.sh` - from my thesis writing times
