## About me


I started my Ph.D. journey at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, fascinated by the world of synchrotron radiation and accelerators. My research focuses on optimizing the performance of particle accelerators, aiming to push the boundaries of scientific discovery.

One of the pivotal moments in my academic journey was a visit to the European Organization for Nuclear Research, more commonly known as CERN. This visit introduced me to the cutting-edge research being conducted in particle physics and provided invaluable insights into the world's largest particle physics laboratory.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at **TRIUMF**, continuing my work in beam dynamics and bunch compressor in linear super conducting electron accelerator.

### Transverse Coherence Visualization
The image below illustrates the **normalized mutual degree of coherence** in the transverse plane of a particle beam, showing how the beamâ€™s coherence evolves and converges with increasing number of particles with random phases:

- **Transverse coherence** refers to how uniform the phase and amplitude are across the beam cross-section.  
- High transverse coherence is essential for producing sharp diffraction patterns and high-quality imaging in synchrotron and FEL experiments.
