There is a plan in the Canadian Light Source (CLS) to replace the current Linac with a new one from Research Instruments GmbH in mid-2024. The first straight section of LTB (Linac-To-Booster) was upgraded to have two BPMs with a 4.79m drift between them, and two phosphor screens were replaced by YAG screens. A new BPM and a YAG-based screen station upgraded the following 90-degree achromat beamline. These upgrades help us to measure the current and future Linac beam parameters, including the beam twiss parameters, energy, and energy spread. In this paper, we discussed how we could use these three BPMs for non-destructive energy measurement, which will be a part of the active energy correction system.
